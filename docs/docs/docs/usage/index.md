## Get Started

To get started with using CasperLens, go to [our application](https://casperlens-taupe.vercel.app). You will be greeted with our home page, showing dashboard for registering contracts.

## Register a smart contract package

Provide a valid smart contract package hash deployed on Casper Testnet. The package hash belongs to smart contracts, CEP-18 tokens or any valid deployment.

Provide a package name used for identifying the package on CasperLens. This need not be the same as the one provided on Casper Network.

The contract package must be successfully added to the tracker.

# Check existing packages

You can check your existing packages registered under your account in the dashboard.
