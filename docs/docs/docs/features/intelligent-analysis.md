# Intelligent Analysis

CasperLens provides an AI-powered analysis mechanism for understanding the implication of differences between 2 contract versions that are chosen by the user or stored on the chain.

It provides insights on field level diff and its implications on user experience, developer experience and security.

Under the hood, it uses Meta's Llama 3.1B Instruct model for generation of the results, to ensure compliance.
