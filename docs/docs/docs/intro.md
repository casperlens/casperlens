# Introduction

CasperLens is a smart contract observability and lifecycle tracking platform for the Casper Network.

Currently, CasperLens supports:

- Smart contract lifecycle monitoring
- Intelligent analysis
- Management for different smart contracts (package, CEP-18 tokens, etc.)
- Transaction and version difference tracking
- Transaction visualizations for observability

This aids smooth integration of smart contracts in application, improved security audits and continuous evolution with collective knowledge. This allows developers to tap into the potential of upgradeable contracts without losing on compliance.
