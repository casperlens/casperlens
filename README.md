# CasperLens

CasperLens is an observability and smart contract lifecycle management platform for the Casper Network.

# Why?

Smart contract lifecycle monitoring and management is essential for ensuring smooth integration in application, auditing for security and integrity and continuous evolution with collective knowledge.

Casper, as a newer and efficient blockchain network allows upgrading smart contracts after deployment, in contrast to other networks such as Ethereum.

However, lack of lifecycle tracking and robust observability of the smart contracts in a transparent manner that preserves integrity causes issues during integration in application development teams and proper analysis of usage of the smart contracts.

# Solution

CasperLens simplifies the process of smart contract lifecycle and changelog management.
